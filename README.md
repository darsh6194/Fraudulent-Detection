## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of transactional data, which includes features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and user information. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraudulent-transaction-detection.git
cd fraudulent-transaction-detection
```

## Usage


## Model Training

The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Cross-validation is used to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

## Results

The results of the model, including performance metrics and visualizations, are documented in the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook. The model achieves a high level of accuracy and effectively identifies fraudulent transactions.
